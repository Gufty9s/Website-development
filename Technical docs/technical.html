            Start-up success can be engineered by following the right process, 
            which means it can be taught. Entrepreneurship is about mastering 
            this process and being able to manage the process from beginning to end, 
            over and over again in several iterations. The traditional manner to start 
            a business is to create a business plan which consists of a number of assumptions, 
            we have a plan fraught with errors and doomed to failure. If one is to compare a 
            Business Plan to a Business Model in practical terms. If a Rocket is the Business 
            Plan and a car is the Business Model, we can start to compare the methods of operation 
            and identify the differences between the two. The rocket requires all steps to be 
            finely tuned and set prior to launch, much the same way we start a business with 
            a business plan. A small error in calculation or assumption can steer the rocker 
            thousands of miles off course. Driving a car requires very little set up prior 
            to driving but requires millions of inputs and corrections to reach the desired 
            destination, much the same way a business model is developed. Instead of making 
            complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions you can make constant 
            adjustments by taking the wheel and driving your idea to a successful business venture. 
            Actually drafting a business plan requires a huge amount of effort which ultimately is a 
            waste of time and money, primarily because most of the assumptions in the business plans 
            are leaps of faith. If they are factual it could lead to huge success, if they prove to be false, 
            total failure. As a start-up we have limited or no resources at our disposal and cannot afford any waste.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            Business model validation as a process or methodology that will validate the entire business 
            model and get the start-up investment ready. It’s a logical, systematic, analytical multivariate 
            process that eliminates chance. It also replaces the haphazard “roll of the dice” process normally 
            associated with start-ups. It de-risks the investment for funders and investors by providing a well 
            vetted opportunity for funding and investment. It gives the entrepreneurs and investors a logical 
            model by which to assess the start-up’s progress and investment readiness. As with any process 
            there are a number of specific requirements which are fundamental requirements which one should 
            have in place prior to departure. Below is a random list of basic requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Please keep in mind that the processes and chapters have been described in a generic fashion
             to cover as many business ideas and sectors as possible. I have avoided focusing on any 
             specific type of business such as retail, services or software. In your validation process 
             these will clearly have an influence on the way you need to approach clients, partners and 
             the types of questions you need to formulate to determine the Customer pain or market opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure you have a good filing system. You will need to do a huge amount of research for your 
            endeavour and this will require you to assemble information for each chapter and for your 
            slide deck which will support your pitch to funders or partners. Essentially, you will need 
            to be an expert, or become an expert in the field or sector in which the business you are 
            building will operate. Electronic data retention would be an ideal tool to replace or support 
            a paper based system.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will need to have access to a slide presentation software to enable you to build your slide deck. 
            This is essential. The skill required to update and adjust this slide show and have various versions 
            will be a big advantage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Access to a computer will be an absolute necessity for the slide deck development and for research
            and this means access to the internet. Many of us take this for granted but where these resources
            are scarce it will require you to make an effort to get access via internet café or similar.
          </li>
          <li>
            I recommend access to BBC or YouTube for viewing the BBC programme “Dragons Den” and “Shark Tank”. 
            It will be useful to see how investment pitches are performed and see what the good and bad pitches 
            look like and the results. It will also give an insight into the way funders get deals done and what
            portion of the business you will need to offer and the types of roles the funders can play in your business. 
            Early stage funders are not just a source of money, they should add value in some way too by 
            contributing to the team.

      <header>Market need</header>
      <article>
        <p>The Customer pain or market need your product or service addresses. How big or how costly 
            is the Customer pain or the market need. Be specific. How will your product or service 
            reduce the Customer pain or the market need or the cost? The common understanding is that 
            if you have a clever idea and develop that into a marketable product that you will make a 
            lot of money. However, the success of such an approach has been proven to be disastrous. 
            Most businesses formed from this approach fail. In some sectors of industry this constitutes 
            all new businesses or 100% failure. Reasons for failure include:</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            promoting and producing a product for which there is no need, or sustainable market.
          </li>
          <li>The enterprise ran out of cash.</li>
          <li>
            They got outcompeted, which once again implies a product for which there is little need
            or indicates poor understanding of the market opportunity.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="product_validation">
      <header>Product validation</header>
      <article>
        <p>
            The concept of validation or customer development stems from the lean approach
            which states that we need to find out from potential customers what their needs 
            are before we build anything. In other words we can have an idea, but before we 
            develop that idea we test it against our customers and learn to change our minds 
            about what is correct before we build. In a way we fail fast and learn more. 
            This allows us to make changes to our idea and to test the new idea with our customers. 
            In this way we do not need to modify the product we already built. We do not need build 
            a product yet and that is the lean aspect of the approach. We are learning without 
            building a product and instead we are talking to potential customers and getting a 
            detailed idea of what the correct product is to build. We can get to a point where 
            we are very specific about the details and features of the product. This is a very 
            generic description of the process, but the purpose is that we need to do the 
            learning on paper or in a minimalistic approach before we spend heaps of money on a 
            product or service the market does not need and will not buy.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            In some instances nothing would be just too little. In a balanced scorecard strategy
            meeting colleagues of mine identified an online service as an aspect we need to add 
            to our enterprise development services. A number of meetings and planning sessions 
            were held to plan and strategize the new online platform. In an unrelated meeting 
            the question of the online platform got raised and a debate ensued about the needs 
            of the organisation versus the needs of our clients. I raised my concern by proposing 
            a minimal viable product approach. There were a few confused stares around the table 
            until I explained. Why not build a platform with only our most basic need developed. 
            Our basic need is for a client to register with us as our CRM software system process 
            is initiated by a registered client. Leave all other services or tools we offer and 
            had discussed off of the online service and let the clients dictate what other aspects 
            of enterprise development they expected to find on the platform, or what services they 
            expected to find from a government agency responsible for enterprise development. 
            In that way we would not build a platform with features that we had decided upon 
            but rather those that the client deem necessary for them. This is a lean approach 
            as we would not develop anything until prompted by the client to develop a specific feature. 
            We can save a lot of resources by not developing features we devised, which the clients might never use. 
            Conversely, we might not develop features which the client would really need or like to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously, like most things today, customer development or validation is a skill and something
             we need to practice to get better and become more skilled. In essence we need to begin listening 
             to the voice of the customer. This takes practice and is counter-intuitive. We need to take the 
             position that everything we know is wrong. We need to learn from scratch. Start to listen instead of talk. 
             Hear what the market is saying.
        </p>
        <p>
            Who to talk to and what to ask in your specific instance is critical to getting the correct feedback. 
            If you approach the wrong people then all the questions you ask will derail your validation. 
            If you talk to the correct people but ask the wrong questions then you will clearly get the wrong answer. 
            So you need to be listening very carefully when you start the process with people for instance, 
            start with people you know. But do not talk about the product, talk about the Customer pain. 
            Once you get some ideas from the closest to you then you can begin to increase the circle you 
            talk to and get them to recommend people who have the same Customer pain. Part of the learning 
            process here is to about finding the correct people to talk to in your market and to learn 
            to ask the correct questions. The process is all about the discovery of the right people, 
            their Customer pain and market needs, the right questions, better questions, customer perceptions and needs. 
            The correct people to talk to would be those you believe are in the market you intend to address and would 
            be able to express an opinion on the customer pain or market need.

    <section class="main-section" id="product_and_technology">
      <header>Product and Technology</header>
      <article>
        <p>What is your product? What is the benefit and who will benefit? How does it address the Customer pain
        or the market need and what is different from the competition or alternatives. 
        Clearly from the discussion that has gone before, the product is the last thing 
        you need to be developing if you have not validated the Customer pain, market need or gap in the market. 
        So, if you have not followed the process described in Chapter 1, you should not do product development.
  
        Does your technology provide a competitive advantage? Is it your own technology or can anyone obtain this technology?
    </p>
          <p>
        If you claim to be the originator of a specific technology, you will need to understand the notion of developed technology.
         It will require you to determine the origins of the technology you employ. 
         If you were previously employed, founded or were a partner in another business or studied at 
         a university where you were exposed to or worked on technology of a similar nature or in the realm of similarity, 
         it could be that they (The Previous employer, partner or university) will see some value in having contributed 
         or somehow co-developed or even assisted you in the development or somehow funded the research which 
         led to your development. So it is imperative to ensure you have total freedom to utilise the technology 
         without any prior art claims being made against you. If you developed this technology or system have you 
         got proof of concept, Prototype, working model, or operational versions. 
         Has this been validated/tested/verified independently?
      </p>
      <p>
        What is your technology? Is it of significant value for you to patent the technology or the unique 
        elements within the technology? Do you have the available funds to finance a costly patent application? 
        Are you willing to disclose your “secret sauce” via the patent which will only afford you protection for a 
        limited period, say 15 years?
      </p>
    </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="market_segmentation">
      <header>Market Segmentation</header>
      <p>
        Can you define the market for your product or service? 
        Are you able to segment your market into well-defined groups? 
        Does each group experience the Customer pain or market need the same way? 
        Can you offer a specific product or service that addresses the Customer pain or market need for each group?
      </p>
      <p>
        Who will be your pilot customer? Do you have a customer who is the first user of your product or service? 
        Identify the person or group who will be the first buyer or pilot customer. 
        Why will they be the first and what specific features will prompt them to be the first buyers or pilot customer?
      </p>
      <p>
        After the pilot and beachhead customers who will be the next segment of the market to address? 
        What are the 2nd and 3rd groups that will buy your product or service? 
        What is different about the specific Customer pain or market need that they are 
        experiencing and what makes them attracted to your product or service?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is our ultimate objective and will require all the traction, 
        credibility and references we can muster. It will also require a 
        serious re-think on many aspects of the business which together with the following 
        four Chapters will determine success or failure.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="your_competition">
      <header>Your competition</header>
      <article>
       Some important tips to consider about your competition are:
        <p>
            Who are your direct competition? Who are those indirect competitors? 
            Who has a similar product or service that will be targeting the same groups as you? 
            Apart from price what are the decision making factors for making your product more favourable than theirs? 
            Complete a matrix of your competitors and all the factors influencing the buying decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you did your Customer pain validation and identified the current solutions it would be 
            wise to include those legacy solutions as competitors as well. They are the currently entrenched 
            providers and you will need to unseat then in order to enter and dominate that market. 
            If you have not done a thorough analysis of the competition it could result in your inability 
            to penetrate the market successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a comprehensive list of all the competition and all the features that are relieving the 
            Customer pain to some degree. Other aspects of the competition could be the revenue strategy or the technology. 
            A good example would be Uber vs metered taxis. Not only does Uber have a different revenue model but the app 
            also provides a technological advantage. So when you evaluate the competition you need to account for aspects 
            other than the direct Customer pain. Maybe the disruptive nature of your offering could provide you with a 
            clear advantage that would be almost impossible to surpass.

    <section class="main-section" id="income_strategy">
      <header>Income strategy</header>
      <article>
        <p>
            For any business to survive and thrive it will need to generate an income, and make a profit. 
            In order to do that it will need a financial structure and mechanism to charge its customers 
            for the product or service. This financial structure we call a model, much the same as the 
            structure of the business we call the business model. How we make money will be dependent on what 
            and where we sell the product or service.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            A typical model is a franchise, where others buy the business model to sell the same product 
            or service as you originally did. They pay an upfront fee to buy the model which could consist 
            of all the branding and marketing designs as well as the means to sell the product. Often they 
            pay a monthly royalty for services such as advertising and promotions. Typically these models 
            range from food outlets to business services and even maintenance services, which create a large 
            network of the same brand owned by different people.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Other models could include rental of equipment such as photocopiers and telephone systems, 
            leasing of equipment and full ownership are also very common. When we view the internet there 
            are a huge array of models such as monthly subscriptions, online purchases and services and the 
            array of products and services is almost endless.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each model has it pricing structure and its margins. What is important in any business is to 
            establish those pricing structures and margins. Obviously cost based structures and margins are 
            useful but there are market driven pricing structures and margins which are not cost driven. 
            Cost driven models are often based on the ability to maintain business at the lowest possible price to market. 
            Whereas, market driven pricing is based on what the customer is willing to pay based on the level of 
            Customer pain endured, and the need for a solution. The bigger the Customer pain and the associated 
            cost the higher the customer would be willing to pay, below that Customer pain cost threshold. 
            When doing the Customer pain validation one would need to identify the cost associated with that 
            Customer pain and in chapter 1 we spoke of identifying the Customer pain and the cost or waste 
            associated with the Customer pain. At this point we need to exploit the frustration or waste the 
            Customer pain is generating, so part of that customer development the quantifying of the Customer pain, 
            waste and frustration will begin to give us an indication of where the price could be.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember there are also costs associated with the current solution, which might not relieve the 
            Customer pain as efficiently as our solution, so there will still be Customer pain that remains 
            and the cost of the current solution and the value of the remaining Customer pain could exploited. 
            What that level is should be validated as part of that customer discovery and development process. 
            What can the customer afford to pay is also a real trigger for the pricing? At the end of the day you 
            need to be offering them a cheaper option than the current cost based on the quantifiable Customer pain. 
            If your pricing cannot offer the cheaper option then you have a serious problem. You will need to go back 
            to do additional validation and perhaps you need to iterate your product offering or pivot to a better solution.

        <p>
            Many would automatically assume that the addressable market would be the world. 
            We are most definitely not considering dominating the world market in three years. 
            So first off this is time based, normally three years, and is realistic based on the 
            validation done in previous chapters. How big is each segment of the market? Can you 
            quantify the value in the various segments of the market?
        </p>
  
        <p>
            Create a bottom up sum of the markets from the beachhead and then add the relevant 
            adjacent segments with a view to what you could achieve in the given time. 
            How will you create awareness of your product or service amongst the beachhead customers? 
            And how will you expand this effort to the adjacent segment clients. 
            The marketing effort must propel you from your pilot customer to the beachhead 
            customers and to your 2nd, 3rd and subsequent adjacent market clients.

        <p>
            The key to developing the Supply Chain is to realise that you cannot go it alone. 
            You will need to integrate your business into networks that already exist. 
            These networks on a basic level include water, electricity, sanitation and other utilities. 
            When looking at your business operations it will be necessary to integrate your operations 
            into the networks of suppliers. What will it take to produce your product or service? 
            What are the logistics required to source and produce your product or service firstly, 
            for the beachhead and subsequent segments?
        </p>
  
       <p>
            On the supply side the product or service development will rely on the sources of the materials, 
            labour, utilities and other inputs. These will need to be identified and validated to provide the 
            best value proposition, material mix, local sources and labour inputs to be successful.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            One needs to consider all the aspects of the value chain. What are the steps you take to get 
            your product or service to the customer? The supply chain management encompasses the planning 
            and management of all activities involved in sourcing, procurement, conversion and all the logistics 
            management activities.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            The validation of these supply chains is linked to the product or service which dictates two basic elements, 
            which are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> 
            the goods and services needed to produce your product or service
        </li>
                <li>
            the development cycle where you decide which materials, processes, tools and resources 
            will be best suited in the creation of the product or delivery of the service.
        </li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>
            This will require talking to the various entities in all of these facets of the value chain 
            to identify the most suitable, functional, practical, appropriate and logical goods and services 
            required to execute your business. Once you have validated all these components of the value chain, 
            you will have a better idea of the cost structure that will be associated with the product or service.

        <p>The key to developing the distribution channels is to realise that you need assistance to deliver 
            your product or service firstly, to the beachhead and later the adjacent segments</p>
        
        <p>On the delivery side is the warehousing, distribution and in many cases the point of sales logistics 
            all need to be identified, considered and validated.</p>
            
        <p>
            Various intermediaries such as delivery services, wholesalers, retailers, agents, hosting services, 
            marketing and advertising agencies, logistics management, installation and servicing all serve 
            the distribution channels. The validation of these channels is linked to the product or service 
            which dictates basic processes or logistics required for the distribution or delivery of the product or service. 
            This will require talking to the various entities in all of these facets of the extended value chain 
            to identify the most suitable, functional, practical, appropriate and logical goods and services 
            required to execute your business. Once you have validated all these components of the value chain, 
            you will have a better idea of the cost structure that will be associated with the product or service.

            Once again it is absolutely essential that you realise it is not possible to go it alone. 
            Strategic partnerships are an amazing way to gain traction, to gain credibility in the market 
            place and to stretch your budget. A great example is Uber and Google maps. Without a map system, 
            the Uber concept would not function. There are many such examples and too many to mention here. 
            But these partnerships can take a number of different formats and do not necessarily need to be formal contracts. 
            Some will however need to be formal contracts, such as your funders will need to have every aspect of the 
            relationship documented and approved by both parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Who will you need to make these products/services a reality? Have you identified the suppliers, 
            raw materials and resources needed to create the product or service and deliver to clients? 
            Who are these partners and what are their roles in your business and are there alternatives?

            Obviously this will be part of the business building phase and not the initial Customer pain validation,
             customer development and product development phase. Once the initial phases have been progressed to a 
             degree where the business can begin to operate as more than just ideas, 
             it will be prudent to start putting plans in place for the next weeks, months and years. 
             These plans will most likely be very basic to begin with and become more detailed and 
             specific with each round of validation for each of the 20 Chapters. At some point you will need to 
             have some very specific timelines and goals to achieve. These need to be assigned to a team member 
             who is best suited and skilled to execute according to the plan.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            The use of a Gantt chart or project management tool would be useful to help plan the way 
            forward and to manage the progress. The more complicated the technology and product development 
            and perhaps the go to market plans are, the more detailed and specific the project planning and 
            management required. Responsibilities for key tasks will need to be assigned and executed. 
            Weekly meetings with the key team members with the assigned responsibilities will be necessary 
            to ensure time lines and goals do not slip. Create your Gantt chart or project plan that captures 
            the critical milestones that you need to accomplish for the next 18 months.
        </p>
  
        <p>Each element that is validated will contribute to the critical milestones or disrupt the achievement 
            of the milestones. Use the validation of the other 18 Chapters of the model to refine and build your 
            project plan and to gauge the progress of the entire organisation based on the individual projects for 
            each line item on your Gantt chart. Clearly there will be dependencies and as the validations get more 
            refined and detailed so will the number of line items and dependencies.</p>

      <header>Funding needs</header>
      <article>
        Specify sources of funding you have identified. 
        Remember Banks and the like will most likely only fund existing businesses. 
        Developmental institutions and grant funding might be one source, 
        Angel funders will fund prior to product validation and Venture capitalists require a working, 
        validated product prior to funding. You might need a number of funders to assist at various stages 
        of the growth such as product development, prototype and production. What is also very important are 
        the types of funding needed and this will determine who you will need to approach. Types of funding requirements are:
  
        <ul>
          <li>Seed funding</li>
          <li>
            Grant funding
          </li>
          <li>
            Government incentives
          </li>
          <li>
            Angel funding
          </li>
          <li>
            Venture Capital funding
          </li>
          <li>
            Equipment and machinery
          </li>
          <li>
            Working capital
          </li>
          <li>
            To complete a contract
          </li>
          <li>
            For expansion
          </li>
          <li>
            To buy a building
          </li>
          <li>
            To buy out your partner
          </li>
          <li>
            To fund exports or imports
          </li>
          <li>
            Or to buy a franchise
          </li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>
            Each different type of funding will have specific requirements and this will therefore 
            require a specific strategy and the appropriate validation. Once you have identified the 
            type of funding you will be targeting, you need to identify who the funders are in that 
            category and what each requires and the typical clients they fund. What are the time frames 
            for funding to ensure making application at the right time to ensure you get funded when the 
            funds are required.
